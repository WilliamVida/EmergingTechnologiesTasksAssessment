    "Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them [17].\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm starts by randomly choosing a centroid value for each cluster. After that the algorithm iteratively performs three steps: (i) Find the Euclidean distance between each data instance and centroids of all the clusters; (ii) Assign the data instances to the cluster of the centroid with nearest distance; (iii) Calculate new centroid values based on the mean values of the coordinates of all the data instances from the corresponding cluster [16].\n",

    "In supervised learning, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset, providing an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data. An unsupervised model, in contrast, provides unlabeled data that the algorithm tries to make sense of by extracting features and patterns on its own [15].\n",

    "The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other [18].\n"
